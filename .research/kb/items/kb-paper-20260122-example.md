## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to structural health monitoring using deep learning techniques. The proposed method achieves 95% accuracy in damage detection.

## Key Contributions

- Novel CNN architecture for vibration signal analysis
- Real-time damage detection pipeline
- Dataset of 10,000 labeled sensor readings

## Methods / Key Details

- Input: Accelerometer time series (1000 Hz sampling)
- Model: 1D-CNN with attention mechanism
- Training: 80/10/10 split, Adam optimizer

## Results (if any)

- Detection accuracy: 95.3%
- False positive rate: 2.1%
- Inference time: 50ms per sample

## Notes

- Authors provide open-source implementation
- Dataset available upon request
- Follow-up work planned for multi-sensor fusion

## Quotes (Optional)

> "Our approach demonstrates that deep learning can effectively replace traditional signal processing methods for SHM applications."
